# Ichi for Ghost


Ichi for Ghost is the result of my first 'mini-project' of 2014. The theme features a minimal, responsive design with a cover page, disqus comment integration, foundation icons and various colour options.


## Demo  
No demo?!?

## Features

**Cover page**  
The landing page for Ichi is a full screen 'cover' featuring your avatar, blog title, mini-bio and cover image. 

**Built with LESS, using Grunt-contrib-less**  
If you know HTML and CSS making modifications to the theme should be super simple.

**Responsive**  
Ichi looks great on all devices, even those weird phablets that nobody buys.

**Disqus comments**  
Disqus integration allows users to comment on your posts.

**Foundation icons**  
Ichi contains the [Foundation icon font by Zurb](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) which means you can easily add icons. A full list of available icons can be found on the [Foundation Icon](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) website.

**No-JS fallback**  
While JS is widely used, some themes and websites don't provide fallback for when no JS is available (I'm looking at you [Squarespace](http://blog.squarespace.com/)). If for some weird reason a visitor has JS disabled your blog will still be useable.

**Development**  
Ghost is still a work in progress with many features not yet implemented, as Ghost gets updated new features will be added to Ichi.
